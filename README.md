## Overview
Welcome to the **MAI_Event** repository! This repository contains an NLP code demo used in the **Master of AI Demo Workshop on Sentiment Analysis**. The focus of this workshop is on sentiment analysis using three different approaches:
1. **Classic Machine Learning Algorithms** (Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
2. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** - a lexicon-based approach
3. **OpenAI API-based Sentiment Analysis** - leveraging a state-of-the-art AI model

## Features
- Hands-on implementation of sentiment analysis using different techniques
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Comparison of model performances using evaluation metrics
- Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanations

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `nltk`
  - `sklearn`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `openai` (for OpenAI API implementation)

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MAI_Event.git
   cd MAI_Event
   ```
2. Install dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Navigate to `Sentiment_Analysis_Demo.ipynb` and follow the steps for sentiment analysis.
